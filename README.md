# solar.itu.dk website

This repository hosts the landing site or homepage for the https://solar.itu.dk website

It is a [Hugo](https://gohuho.io) website with a runner to build and deploy it to the server.

## Documentation

Documentation is still a WIP, you can find the few articles in the [documentation wiki.](https://solar.itu.dk/docs) 

### Documentation to-dos and roadmap
- [ ] Hardware and power circuit
- [ ] How-to make projects
    - [ ] Static websites
    - [ ] Dynamic websites/Web apps
    - [ ] Containerisation
- [ ] Current working configurations 
- [ ] Things to consider when deploying on the solar server 


## Roadmap and to-dos

While the project has achieved a basic functioning mode, we are constantly developing it so the server can become and infrastructure for teaching and experimentation.

We could use some help with this, if you are interested in helping with any of the following, please email Luis at [luil@itu.dk](mailto:luil@itu.dk).

### To-Do for Homepage

- [-] Fully automatic website update
  - [x] Build script working
  - [ ] Push socket to trigger script
- [ ] Accesibility audit
    - [ ] Additional accesibility settings for increased contrast and changing font sizes 
- [ ] Offline reading
    - [ ] The site will be unavailable during winter, we can circumvent this by making an offline version or using a different distribution such as RSS
    - [ ] A printable version of th website can also be used for offline reading during the dark months

### To-Do for Solar Server installation

- [ ] Find a way to measure and write energy/power metrics externally
- [ ] Collect information about energy for analysis
