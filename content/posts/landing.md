This is a solar-powered website, which means it sometimes goes offline

This website runs on a solar powered server located on the roof of the [IT university of copenhagen](https://itu.dk/). This server setup and website came to be during a artist residency by [Jacob Remin](https://www.jacobremin.com/), hosted by the [Center for Climate IT](https://ccit.itu.dk/) in 2024-2025.

the website draws a lot of inspiration from the [solar website of LOW←TECH MAGAZINE](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/) as well as the [hedge doc pad](https://pad.data.coop/) hosted by [data coop](https://data.coop/)

Made with generous help and support from James Maguire, Frauke Tom H Mennes, Luis Alfredo Landa Mariaca, Sebastian Büttrich, Julian Charles Philip Priest, Yucheng Lu, Halfdan Hauch Jensen and Halfdan Mouritzen.
