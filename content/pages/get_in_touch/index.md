This is an open project that actively invites new ideas for services to run on the server. [Do get in touch on](mailto:frme@itu.dk)Â if you would like to suggest a project / host something or if you have suggestions / corrections or things to add.

The setup for running this website is open source. The source code and documentation for the project lives [here](https://github.com/jsr606/solar.itu.dk) and serves as an example of how to host projects on the solar server.
