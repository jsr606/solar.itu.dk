Why a solar powered server on the top of ITU?

When thinking about IT, we often think within the frameworks of limitless and frictionless growth. Most IT and server infrastructure is virtualized and outsourced to a degree where most people (and IT students) have no idea of where their data and server infrastructure lives.

This data centre hosts a website presenting the project and a pad for online text editing and collaboration. It is the first step in setting up an insfrastructure to share and develop ideas for students and researchers at ITU in a sustainable way. If the sun is gone for several days and the compute load is too high, the battery will become depleted and the server will go offline. How badly the server will be affected by the danish weather and our compute load remains to be tested over time.

By consciously imposing infrastructural constraints to our work, we are forced to think within limits. What do we do when the server is down? What can we do to ease the compute load?
